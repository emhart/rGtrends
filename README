rGtrends is an interface for a python [Google trends](http://www.google.com/trends) API created by [Sal Uryasev](Sal Uryasev).  It works by downloading a temporary CSV within a python environment, parsing it, sending it to R, and parsing it a bit more into a dataframe.  As of 9/27/2012 Google changed it's interface for Trends and merged it with insight.  At the moment only raw search volume data can be downloaded.  Once the python code is updated I will return the functionality of parsing search results by region and language.
